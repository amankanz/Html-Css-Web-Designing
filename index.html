    <h1>WebDevelopment</h1>
    <p>Hi,</p>
    <p>
      My name is Amani Zihalirwa you can call me Kareem and I love
      WebDevelopment. <br />
      my Gaol is to be one the best WebDeveloper in Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are language we shall be learning as we engage on this
      journey. SO, get excited! &#128525;
    </p>
    <h2>FrontEnd Developement</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>HTML and CSS</li>
      <li>JavaScript</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>WebDesigning</h2>
    <p>
      To be a good WebDeveloper in my opion I beloive you need to known how to
      make things <br />
      look really good and attrictive "i mean this".
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to make an idea to look good like user friendly <br />
      you will have to learn other concepts that follow under WebDesigning.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>UX Design</li>
      <p>
        This concept will help you undersatnd how to make design <br />
        more user friendly.
        <br />
        There are tools we use and books to read that will make your learning
        process easy.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <p>
      I want to be able to think about an idea and then sit down <br>
      and start working on it through designing:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The look
        </li>
        <li>
          Whitespaces, colors, etc.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      After done with the design, You've got everything they way <br>
      you want it to appear to the users then you go ahead and start developing <br>
      the design through actual CODE (FrontEnd Dev) &#128526;
    </p>
    <h2>
      WebDevelopment journey
    </h2>
    <p>
      Web Developement has a kind of structure to follow:
      <ol>
        <li>
          WebDesigning
          <P>
            This is where as a designer you come up with the look <br>
            of what you planning to develop. If it's a website, you design the way you want it to look like.
          </P>
        </li>
        <li>
          WebDevelopement
          <p>
            This is where as a developer you create whatever has been design using code. <br>
            And we discussed the langues we use to developer website which has been designed.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am so interested in knowing at the end of this journey which one of this two paths I am going <br>
      to choose as a career.
      <ol>
        <li>

        </li>
        or 
        <li>
          WebDevelopement
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
